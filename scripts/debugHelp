# -d   enables debugging. Any characters in the string after this will enable debug flags like these:
#
#
# a    userprog/UserProcess.java debug flags
# c    machine/Coff.java and machine/CoffSection.java debug flags
# i    machine/Interrupt.java debug flags
# M    some flag inside of machine/Processor.java that we don't call. it's called "dbgFullDisassemble".
# m    some flag inside of machine/Processor.java that we don't call. it's called "dbgDisassemble" though.
# p    machine/Processor.java debug flags
# S    security/NachosSecurityManager.java debug flags
# t    threads/KThread.java debug flags
# v    vm/VMKernel.java, vm/VMProcess.java, debug flags - doesn't really seem to be called, either.
